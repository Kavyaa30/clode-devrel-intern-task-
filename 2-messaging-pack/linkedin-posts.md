## Post 1: Platform Engineering Reality

Platform engineering has exploded over the last few years.

But many teams still confuse:
- More tools 
- With better developer experience 

In reality, true platforms remove friction across the entire lifecycle — deploy → operate → monitor.

If engineers still spend hours managing infrastructure, responding to alerts, or fixing environment issues, the platform isn’t doing its job.

Clode sits exactly in this layer.
It focuses on automating cloud operations so engineers can spend more time shipping features and less time babysitting infrastructure.

## Post 2: Learning from the DevOps Tooling Landscape

Looking across today’s DevOps tooling ecosystem, a clear pattern emerges:

• Many tools focus heavily on setup  
• Fewer tools help with day-2 operations  
• Almost none remove ongoing manual operational work  

This is where AI-powered automation becomes critical.

The future of DevOps isn’t more dashboards or alerts.
It’s systems that can operate themselves wherever possible.

Less manual intervention.
More autonomous cloud operations.
